# Dry lab guides for computing in the Petrov Lab

The main aim of this repo is to have a central place for dry-lab/computing knowledge in the lab. Onboarding onto Sherlock and making use of the cluster can be a bit painful without any guidance. Different people also utilize different tools, and it can be helpful to keep all that knowledge documented somewhere.
